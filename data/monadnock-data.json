                    "text": "<div><p>In early August of 1862, Henry David Thoreau climbed Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire, one of his favorite mountains, accompanied by his friend Ellery Channing. Thoreau took bearings from the summit and later used these to sketch a map that he included in his Journal entry for August 9. This map tour highlights several features of Thoreau's map.</p><p>In the Journal, the map appears upside-down in relation to the text on the preceding page. That's most likely because Thoreau began by using the bearings he'd taken, drawing the landscape as it appeared from his south-facing view at the summit. This put South at the top of the map, contrary to convention. Eventually, Thoreau rotated the map 180 degrees to add many of his labels. For the purposes of this tour, the map at left has also been rotated so that North is at top and the labels are easier to read.</p><p>Thoreau's map is much more than a simple freehand rendering. Only a cartographer or skilled surveyor could produce work of this quality. Owing to the compass bearings Thoreau took from the summit on August 8 and a linear measurement methodology he developed, the map's scale is true and the angles of its bearing lines are precise.</p><p>As you move through this tour of Thoreau's map, you'll zoom in on selected features, but you can always click-hold-drag to move around in the map and explore.</p></div>"

The triangle may represent the spruce lean-to in which Thoreau slept. In a letter to H. G. O. Blake, his companion on his previous, 1858, trip to Monadnock, he referred to this site as <q>that memorable stone 'chunk yard,' in which we made our camp.</q></p><p>An important feature not distinguishable on the printed map as it appears in Houghton Mifflin's 1906 edition of Thoreau's collected writings, or in any other printed version, is the penciled word <q>Ravine</q> inside Thoreau's ink label <q>Swamp.</q> While no map or book cites this ravine as a notable feature, there is no question about its presence when reaching the summit via the eastern approaches. On both the Pumpelly Trail and the White Dot Trail, visitors make a steep and rocky descent at about 2,800 feet prior to the final steep ascent up the rocks to the summit.</p><p>The curved line to the right of the word extending northeast from the end of the word <q>Ravine</q>, then curving westward as it passes <q>Peak</q> (see detail below), marks the ravine itself.
