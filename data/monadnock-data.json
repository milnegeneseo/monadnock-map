                    "text": "<div><p>In early August of 1860, Henry David Thoreau climbed Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire, one of his favorite mountains, accompanied by his friend Ellery Channing. From the summit, Thoreau took bearings of the mountain&rsquo;s spurs and later used these to sketch a map that he included in his Journal entry for August 9. This map tour highlights several features of Thoreau&rsquo;s map.</p><p>In the Journal, the map appears upside-down in relation to the text on the preceding page. That&rsquo;s most likely because Thoreau began by using the bearings he&rsquo;d taken, drawing the landscape as it appeared from his south-facing view at the summit. This put South at the top of the map, contrary to convention. Thoreau turned the Journal volume more than once in the course of adding labels to bearing lines and other features; his compass meridian line indicates that he finally decided on a <q>North up</q> orientation. For the purposes of this tour, the map at left has also been rotated so that North is at top and the labels are easier to read.</p><p>Thoreau&rsquo;s map is much more than a simple freehand rendering. Only a cartographer or skilled surveyor could produce work of this quality. Owing to the compass bearings Thoreau took from the summit on August 8 and a linear measurement methodology he developed, the map&rsquo;s scale is true and the angles of its bearing lines are precise.</p><p>As you move through this tour of Thoreau&rsquo;s map, you&rsquo;ll zoom in on selected features, but you can always click-hold-drag to move around in the map and explore.</p><p xmlns:cc='http://creativecommons.org/ns#' xmlns:dct='http://purl.org/dc/terms/'><a property='dct:title' rel='cc:attributionURL' href='https://milnegeneseo.github.io/monadnock-map/index.html'>StoryMapJS Tour of Thoreau&rsquo;s Map of Mount Monadnock</a> by <a rel='cc:attributionURL dct:creator' property='cc:attributionName' href='https://paulschacht.net'>Paul Schacht</a> is licensed under <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1' target='_blank' rel='license noopener noreferrer' style='display:inline-block;'>CC BY-SA 4.0<img style='height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;' src='https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg?ref=chooser-v1' alt=''><img style='height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;' src='https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg?ref=chooser-v1' alt=''><img style='height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;' src='https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/sa.svg?ref=chooser-v1' alt=''></a></p><p>Text by Robert M.

The triangle may represent the spruce lean-to in which Thoreau slept. Thoreau slept at this site for two nights on his 1858 trip to Monadnock with H. G. O. Blake, later referring to it, in a letter to Blake, as <q>that memorable stone &lsquo;chunk yard,&rsquo; in which we made our humble camp</q>(<em>Correspondence</em> 1958, 595&ndash;596).</p><blockquote>We chose a sunken yard in a rocky plateau on the southeast side of the mountain, perhaps half a mile from the summit, by the path, a rod and a half wide by many more in length, with a mossy and bushy floor about five or six feet beneath the general level, where a dozen black spruce trees grew, though the surrounding rock was generally bare. (<em>Journal</em> 1906, 10:455; June 2, 1858)</blockquote><p>Thoreau and Channing slept at the same site for two nights on their 1860 trip.</p><p>An important feature not distinguishable on the printed map as it appears in the 1906 edition of Thoreau&rsquo;s Journal, or in any other printed version, is the penciled word <q>Ravine,</q> around which Thoreau has inked a patch of dashes and dots that he labels <q>Swamp.</q> While no map or book cites this ravine as a notable feature, there is no question about its presence when reaching the summit via the eastern approaches. At about 2,800 feet, hikers on both the Pumpelly Trail and the White Dot Trail make a steep and rocky descent to a boggy area prior to the final steep ascent up the rocks to the summit.</p><p>The penciled line extending northeast from the end of the word <q>Ravine,</q> curving westward as it passes <q>Peak</q> (see detail below), marks the ravine itself. That marking is important because it establishes the location of Thoreau&rsquo;s first camp as being west of the stream that runs down the middle of the ravine and also south of the rocky cap\u2014most likely just off the Paradise Valley Trail.<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 80%;\"><img src=\"https://milnegeneseo.github.io/monadnock-map/images/map_detail_ravine_line.jpg\" alt=\"Map detail showing line marking a ravine\"></div></p>"

A line, first dotted and then solid, runs from that swamp north towards the village of Dublin (not indicated on the map). The name of that stream is Mountain Brook. The smaller swamp is on the southern side of the ridge and is marked but not labeled. From that swamp, a line representing Ark Brook runs to the southeast.<blockquote>P. M. — Walked to the wild swamp at the northeast spur. That part is perhaps the most interesting for the wild confusion of its variously formed rocks, and is the least, if at all, frequented. We found the skull and jaws of a large rodent, probably a hedgehog, — larger than a woodchuck&rsquo;s, — a considerable quantity of dry and hard dark-brown droppings, of an elliptical form, like very large rat-droppings, somewhat of a similar character but darker than the rabbit&rsquo;s, and I suspect that these were the porcupine&rsquo;s.<br><br>Returned over the top at 5 p. m., after the visitors, men and women, had descended, and so to camp.
