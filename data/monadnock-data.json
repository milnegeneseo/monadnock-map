                    "text": "From his experience as a surveyor, Thoreau knew how to use a compass in the field, but his map of Mt. Monadnock also shows his creative system for measuring distance.\n\n<blockquote>The basis of my map was the distance from the summit to the second camp, made by rudely casting a stone before. Pacing the distance of an easy cast, I found it about ten rods, and thirteen such stone\u2019s throws, or one hundred and thirty rods, carried me to the camp. As I had the course, from the summit, and from the camp, of the principal points, I could tell the rest nearly enough. It was about fifty rods from the summit to the ravine and eighty more to the camp. (H. D. Thoreau, <em>The Journal of Henry D. Thoreau</em>, XIV:39)\n</blockquote>\n\nWith his Journal open to the still blank recto page, Thoreau made his starting point, marked \"Peak\" on the map, the location where he stood to take his bearings on August 8. Because of the mountain's footprint, he instinctively knew that the summit point should not be positioned in the center of the page. Beginning at a point just right of center, he entered the north-south lines, \u201cfaced\u201d south, measured S40E, and drew the bearing line a distance of one hundred thirty rods to \"2D Camp,\" with a scale of eighty rods to the inch. With the bearing line and position of that camp set on the paper, the other bearing lines, contours, trails, streams, and points of interest all fell into place."

On both the Pumpelly Trail and the White Dot Trail, visitors make a steep and rocky descent at about 2,800 feet prior to the final steep ascent up the rocks to the summit. A close look at Thoreau\u2019s map reveals a curved line to the right of the word \u201cPeak.\u201d This line is a mark of that ravine, and it begins where he wrote the word \u201cRavine.\u201d</p>\n\nThat designation is important because it establishes the location of Thoreau's first camp as being west of the stream that runs down the middle of the ravine and also south of the rocky cap\u2014most likely just off the Paradise Valley Trail. Immediately beside \u201c1st Camp,\u201d Thoreau drew a circle with a dotted line to mark the rocky mesa near the camp. Just to the west of the circle is a very small triangle, possibly representing the shape of the spruce lean-to in which Thoreau and his companions slept. In a letter to H. G. O. Blake, his companion on the 1858 trip to Monadnock, he referred to this site as \u201cthat memorable stone 'chunk yard,' in which we made our camp.\u201d"
