Thoreau took bearings from the summit and later used these to sketch a map that he included in his Journal entry for August 9. This map tour highlights several features of Thoreau's map.</p><p>In the Journal, the map appears upside-down in relation to the text of the preceding page. That's most likely because Thoreau began by using the bearings he'd taken, drawing the landscape as it appeared from his south-facing view at the summit. This put South at the top of the map, contrary to convention. Eventually, Thoreau rotated the map 180 degrees to add many of his labels. For the purposes of this tour, the map at left has also been rotated so that North is at top and the labels are easier to ready.</p><p>Thoreau's map is much more than a simple freehand rendering. Only a cartographer or skilled surveyor could produce work of this quality. Owing to the compass bearings Thoreau took from the summit on August 8 and a linear measurement methodology he developed, the map's scale is true and the angles of its bearing lines are precise.</p><p>As you move through this tour of Thoreau's map, you'll zoom in on selected features, but you can always click-hold-drag to move around in the map and explore.</p></div>"

Monadnock also shows his creative system for measuring distance.</p><blockquote>The basis of my map was the distance from the summit to the second camp, made by rudely casting a stone before. Pacing the distance of an easy cast, I found it about ten rods, and thirteen such stone\u2019s throws, or one hundred and thirty rods, carried me to the camp. As I had the course, from the summit, and from the camp, of the principal points, I could tell the rest nearly enough. It was about fifty rods from the summit to the ravine and eighty more to the camp. (H. D. Thoreau, <em>The Journal of Henry D. Thoreau</em>, XIV:39)</blockquote><p>With his Journal open to the still blank recto page, Thoreau made his starting point the location where he stood to take his bearings on August 8, marked <q>Peak</q> on the map. Because of the mountain's footprint, he knew that the summit point should not be positioned in the center of the page. Beginning at a point just right of center, he entered the north-south lines, <q>faced</q> south, measured S40E, and drew the bearing line a distance of 130 rods to <q>2D Camp</q>, with a scale of 80 rods to the inch, at some point noting the scale near the map's bottom right corner (when viewed with north at top). With the bearing line and position of that camp set on the paper, the other bearing lines, contours, trails, streams, and points of interest all fell into place.</p><p><a href=\"https://milnegeneseo.github.io/monadnock-map/images/map_scale.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://milnegeneseo.github.io/monadnock-map/images/map_scale.jpg\"<alt=\"Thoreau's notation of the map's scale.\" /></a><br><em>Thoreau's notation of the map's scale.

An important feature not distinguishable on the printed map as it appears in the 1906 Torrey and Allen edition of Thoreau's collected writings, or in any other printed version, is the penciled word \u201cRavine\u201d inside Thoreau's marking of a <q>Swamp.</q> (See detail above, which shows the map in its north-at-top orientation for ease of reading.)</p><p>While no map or book cites this ravine as a notable feature, there is no question about its presence when reaching the summit via the eastern approaches. On both the Pumpelly Trail and the White Dot Trail, visitors make a steep and rocky descent at about 2,800 feet prior to the final steep ascent up the rocks to the summit. A close look at Thoreau\u2019s map reveals a curved line to the right of the word \u201cPeak.\u201d This line is a mark of that ravine, and it begins where he wrote the word \u201cRavine.\u201d</p><p>That designation is important because it establishes the location of Thoreau's first camp as being west of the stream that runs down the middle of the ravine and also south of the rocky cap\u2014most likely just off the Paradise Valley Trail. Immediately beside \u201c1st Camp,\u201d Thoreau drew a circle with a dotted line to mark the rocky mesa near the camp. Just to the west of the circle is a very small triangle, possibly representing the shape of the spruce lean-to in which Thoreau and his companions slept. In a letter to H. G. O. Blake, his companion on the 1858 trip to Monadnock, he referred to this site as \u201cthat memorable stone 'chunk yard,' in which we made our camp.\u201d</p>"
